# Instructions

## This Assignment

For an assignment from the textbook, if the assignment indicates a specific file name, you must name your file exactly as it appears in the textbook. Otherwise, it will fail to be built correctly and will receive no points.

## General

To complete an assignment, you must follow the specific tasks above and do the following:

* Edit the README.md file:
  * Change _your name here_ and _date_ as the beginning of the file
  * Reread the __Honor Pledge__ again and 'sign' it with your name at the end
  * Add your own text in the __Description__ and __What I Learned__ sections
  
* Ensure that what you push to the github repository builds correctly (the build badge displays as [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ChapmanCPSC230Spring16/Assignment-X.svg)]())
