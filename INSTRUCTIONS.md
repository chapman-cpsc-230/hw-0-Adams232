# Instructions

## This Assignment

For an assignment from the textbook, if the assignment indicates a specific file name, you must name your file exactly as it appears in the textbook. Otherwise, it will fail to be built correctly and will receive no points.

## General


* Edit the README.md file:
    * Change _your name here_ and _date_ as the beginning of the file
    * Edit the line ```[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ChapmanCPSC230Spring16/assignment-X-YYYYYYYY.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ChapmanCPSC230Spring16/assignment-X-YYYYYYYY)``` replacing ```X``` with the assignment number and ```YYYYYYYY``` with your github user name. The result should look like the name of the repository.
    * Reread the __Honor Pledge__ again and 'sign' it with your name at the end
    * Add your own text in the __Description__ and __What I Learned__ sections


* Connnect the repository to Travis CI
    * On the github site, go to ```settings``` then to ```Webhooks & services```
    * Then click on ```Add service``` and scroll to ```Travis CI```.
    * This takes you to a new page. Scroll to the bottom and click ```Add service```


* Ensure that what you push to the github repository builds correctly (the build badge displays as [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ChapmanCPSC230Spring16/Assignment-X.svg)]()) in the README file.
